QuickMatch: A Heuristic Algorithm for Compute Edge 
                Colorings on Regular Bipartite Multigraphs

                    By: Andrew Hannigan '13

Getting Started:
1) cd into c/
2) run "make test"
3) run "./test.out"
4) Select either 2 and 5 to see the QuickMatch algorithm in action


C code contains the primary business logic of the QuickMatch algorithm

graph.c:	Contains all data-structures and helper methods for graphs.

quickmatch.c:	Implements QuickMatch algorithm

alternating.c:	Implements all six methods of finding augmenting paths

cycles.c:	Implements Euler splits

color.c:	Combines all code to find an edge coloring of a regular bipartite graph 

testing.c:	All testing code

main.c:		UI for running test code	


Used to create exacutable tests that are run by bash scripts in the "scripts" directory
-alttest.c	
-dtest.c
-ntest.c



scripts/ directory generates statistics on QuickMatch trials

ALL.bash: 	Runs all tests.  Requires that "thesis" directory is placed in a parent directory 
		with a csv directory

stop.bash:	Stops all tests.  This allows tests that are being run in the background from a
		previous session to still be stopped easily.  Useful when running tests on a remote
		system.


python/ directory contains code for creating plots of data for QuickMatch analysis

plot_tests.py 	Generates all plots used in thesis write up.  CSV_DIR contains the directory of the
		.csv files.  The default is that csv/ is in the parent directory of thesis/.  This
		code requires that matplotlib is available to python.  This is dependency is not 
		satisfied by icecream.
